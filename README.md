# PSR-0 and PSR-4 class autoloading #

This library provides a way to support both PSR-0 class autoloading by adding
base paths for where to look classes and PSR-4 class autoloading by adding
prefixed namespace paths for classes. The most important functionality of the
class autoloader is to map class names to different files according to given
rules.

API documentation for the classes can be generated using apigen.

## Usage ##

Easiest way to use the class loader is to put all your classes in a single
directory with sub directories according to their namespaces. By doing this,
you can just add the base directory to the class loader and let it handle the
rest.

```php
<?php
$loader = new Riimu\Kit\ClassLoader\BasePathLoader();
$loader->addBasePath('/path/to/classes/');
$loader->register();
```

You may also add the directory to your include_path and allow the class loader
to use it via `setLoadFromIncludePath()`. Both of these methods are intended
for loading classes according to the PSR-0 standard.

The PSR-4 standard defines a way to define prefixes for class namespaces to load
classes from directories that do not entirely correspond their namespace
structure. To add prefixes, you can, for example, do following:

```php
<?php
$loader = new Riimu\Kit\ClassLoader\BasePathLoader();
$loader->addPrefixPath('Vendor\Mylib', '/path/to/MyLib/');
$loader->register();
```

For working examples, see the files in the examples directory.
